# M3.1 — Likelihood-free baselines DoD verification checklist

Target chapter: `book/likelihood-free-baselines.qmd`

## Definition of Done (DoD)

### A. Chapter execution
- [ ] `book/likelihood-free-baselines.qmd` executes without manual intervention when rendering the book.
- [ ] Runtime is reasonable for CI (avoid long simulation counts).

### B. Method coverage
- [ ] ABC section runs and produces a minimal diagnostic (e.g., accepted beta histogram with beta_true marked).
- [ ] SMC-ABC section runs and produces a minimal diagnostic (e.g., final-round weighted histogram and an ESS readout).
- [ ] Synthetic likelihood section runs and produces a minimal diagnostic (e.g., trace plot and/or posterior predictive overlay).

### C. Acceptance gates
- [x] `uv run pytest -q` passes.
- [x] `quarto render book --to html` passes.

## Verification notes

- 2026-02-13: initial render failed because `quarto` was not found on PATH.
- 2026-02-13: rerun after installing Quarto `1.8.27` succeeded; log: `portfolio/reports/logs/diff-epi-inference-handbook/20260213_192438_M3.1.log`.
