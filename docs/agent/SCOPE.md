# SCOPE

This repository contains a Quarto-rendered handbook plus a small companion Python package.

In scope:
- Runnable, tested code supporting the book chapters.
- Book chapters that render to HTML (and optionally PDF).
- CI that runs tests and renders the HTML book.

Out of scope (for now):
- Large-scale training runs or heavyweight dependencies by default.
