# Data directory

This directory is for **generated** or **local** datasets.

- Synthetic datasets can be created with `scripts/make_synthetic_dataset.py`.
- Output files under `data/` are ignored by git (see `.gitignore`).

If you want to commit a small example dataset for the handbook, add an explicit
exception in `.gitignore` and keep the file(s) tiny.
