This handbook introduces practical inference workflows for infectious-disease models, with an emphasis on:

- clear model assumptions and equations,
- runnable examples that scale from classical baselines to modern simulation-based inference,
- and diagnostics that keep uncertainty quantification honest.

## Who this is for

- Researchers and practitioners who want to understand inference for epidemic models without relying on opaque tooling.
- Readers comfortable with basic probability and willing to work through small, executable examples.

## Reading paths

- Practical path: `running-example` → `classical-baselines` → `likelihood-free-baselines` → `validation-and-robustness`.
- Gradient-first path: `autodiff-basics` → `differentiability-axis` → `gradient-estimators` → `modern-sbi`.

## Reproducibility

- The companion package is intentionally lightweight and tested.
- The same source renders to both **HTML** and **PDF**.
- CI executes the HTML build to keep examples reproducible over time.
