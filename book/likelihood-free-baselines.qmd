title: "Likelihood-free baselines"
---

This chapter introduces likelihood-free baselines for the running example.
These methods are useful when the simulator is non-differentiable and/or when a tractable likelihood is unavailable.

## Goals (M3)

- Implement and demonstrate **ABC rejection** as a minimal, robust baseline.
- (Optional) extend to **SMC-ABC** for better efficiency.
- Introduce **synthetic likelihood** / likelihood-on-summaries as a bridge between ABC and modern SBI.

## Outline

### 1) Setup: summaries and distances

- Choose summary statistics $s(y)$ for the observed time series (e.g. peak size/time, total cases, early growth rate).
- Define a distance $d(s(y), s(y_{\mathrm{sim}}))$.
- Discuss the trade-off between informativeness and dimensionality.

### 2) ABC rejection

- Sample $\theta \sim p(\theta)$.
- Simulate $y_{\mathrm{sim}} \sim p(\cdot \mid \theta)$.
- Accept if $d(s(y), s(y_{\mathrm{sim}})) \leq \varepsilon$.

Deliverables:

- A reusable `abc_rejection(...)` helper in `diff_epi_inference.abc`.
- A small demo on the running example (start with `beta`-only, then expand).

### 3) (Optional) SMC-ABC

- Sequence of tolerances $\varepsilon_1 > \varepsilon_2 > \cdots$.
- Reweight/resample/perturb particles.
- Monitor acceptance rates and particle degeneracy.

### 4) Synthetic likelihood (on summaries)

- Assume $s(y) \mid \theta \approx \mathcal{N}(\mu_\theta, \Sigma_\theta)$.
- Estimate $(\mu_\theta, \Sigma_\theta)$ via repeated simulations at fixed $\theta$.
- Use the resulting approximate likelihood inside MH/HMC.

## Notes

- These baselines are intentionally simple and prioritise clarity over efficiency.
- Later chapters will revisit summary selection, amortisation, and calibration at scale.
